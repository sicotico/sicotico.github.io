## Professional Summary
Over my 21-year professional career, I have shifted fields whenever I felt the need to acquire new skills. I started in bare-metal automation, Xen, and VMWare. The complexity of managing these projects led me to specialize in ITIL and the implementation of HP Software tools. Later, I moved into RPA automation, with cloud integration becoming the primary focus of this latest phase in my career.
